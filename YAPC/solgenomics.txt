Solgenomics: Slicing and Dicing Plant Genomes with Perl

The Sol Genomics Network (SGN) is a website which is a platform for plant biologists and
breeders to search for, curate and visualize data related to plant genomics. SGN is a
part of the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, located at Cornell University,
and is funded by the National Science Foundation.

The SGN website is written in Perl 5 and relies on Catalyst, Moose, DBIx::Class and thousands
of other CPAN modules. It is a great example of how Perl is being used in academic research
and every line of code is open source and available on Github.

This lightning talk will give a high-level description of how SGN uses Perl to help researchers
find, manipulate and visualize their data as well as how SGN contributes back to the Perl 
community.
