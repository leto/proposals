Visual Introduction to Parrot Virtual Machine

Parrot Virtual Machine is a seemingly-complex piece of software that dedicated hackers have been
working on for over ten years. It currently has mature implementations of Perl 6 and Lua, and
many dozens of in-progress implementations for every language under the sun.

Because Parrot development moves fast, the documentation for any given subsystem is sometimes
lagging. It can be hard for a newcomer to understand how all the pieces fit together.

I propose to fix this problem by providing a "Visual Introduction" to Parrot, which will
focus on information-dense pictures that show how the different parts of Parrot fit together.

The first half of the talk will focus on what the building blocks of Parrot are, and how they
fit together, while the second half of the talk will concentrate on how languages built on
Parrot (known as High Level Languages or HLLs) interact with the virtual machine.

Attendees of this talk will leave with a valuable understanding of how Parrot and HLLs on
Parrot work that will be useful for years to come, instead of being told a bunch of details
that will be quickly obsoleted.
