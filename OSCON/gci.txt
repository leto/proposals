Google Code-In : Will It Help Your Community?

Google Code-In is a contest designed to introduce pre-university students from
around the world to various open source communities. Google Code-In 2010 was a
huge success, with 361 students (ages 13-18) from 48 countries completing a
total of 2,167 tasks during the 7 week contest period.

Each task is a small unit of work designed by people from the open source community,
and tasks can range from being research, web design, documentation translation, code,
graphic design and more. Open source communities get to design basically any task
that introduces students to the community and makes the student learn something while
providing value back to the community.

There were 20 organizations involved in 2010, and I suspect Google will expand it in
the coming years, since it fills a much-needed niche of apprenticeship for extremely
young and talented students. Should your open source community be involved?

This talk will contain lessons learned from being the Organization Admin for The Perl
Foundation and Parrot Foundation in Google Code-In 2010, as well as what future org
admins, mentors and students can expect. It will also describe in detail what it takes
to make Code-In a valuable experience for all and pitfalls to avoid.
