Title:

It is Xmas in your database : PL/Perl6

Abstract:

PL/Perl6 is a new PostgreSQL Procedural Language that allows one to write
stored procedures in Perl 6.

Full Description:

A running joke in the Perl 6 world used to be that weâ€™ll release a stable Perl
6 by Xmas. We just never said which Xmas. Xmas recently happened in July, with
the release of Rakudo Star Perl 6.

Xmas is here, you can embed Perl 6 in your database!

PL/Perl6 is built upon PL/Parrot. PL/Parrot is the Parrot Virtual Machine,
embedded into the PostgreSQL relational database. PL/Perl6 works by embedding
Rakudo Perl 6, an implementation of Perl 6 on Parrot, into PostgreSQL, which
allows it to be used as a stored procedure language.

This talk will give a quick introduction to Parrot VM and Rakudo Perl 6, and
why you would want them in your database, including a status update of the
current feature set of Rakudo Perl 6 and PL/Perl6. Example stored procedures in
Perl 6 will be shown and, time permitting, the internals of how
PL/Perl6 works will be described. More information can be found at
http://pl.parrot.org .
