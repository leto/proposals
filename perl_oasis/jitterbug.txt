Do The Jitterbug: Continuous Integration With Git

Jitterbug is an exciting new continuous integration tool that integrates with
Git. The goal of Jitterbug is to know how to build and run the test suite code
in *any language*. Currently, there is autodetection support for Perl 5+6,
Python, Parrot, Ruby and Makefile-based projects and many more are on the way.

Jitterbug can be used as a post-receive hook on Github or with pure-Git
configurations as well. It has a pretty web interface that shows a history of
commits, with links to test suite outputs and the commitdiff. Jitterbug also
has a highly configurable email notifier, that can send email when test suites
fail or pass, and allows templated headers and footers to allow for a
customized email that contains links to relevant bug trackers or integration
environments.

Jitterbug is written in Perl 5 and uses the new Dancer web framework to show a
web interface of continuous integration data.

This talk will contain a brief introduction to how Jitterbug works, a full
tutorial on how to install Jitterbug, how to add it as a post-receive hook on
Github and finally how to customize Jitterbug emails to be as useful as
possible.
