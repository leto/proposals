Title: Math::GSL, Math::MatrixReal and PDL Interoperability

Name: Jonathan Leto

Duration:  28 hrs

Synopsis: 

    Allow Math::GSL::Matrix and Math::MatrixReal objects to be converted to
    piddles and vice versa for compatible piddles.  This will provide an "easy
    onramp" for a user of any one of these modules to use features from the
    others in the same project. At a social level, this should have the effect
    of integrating similar Perl communities and giving people doing scientific
    computing with Perl more options and fewer arbitrary barriers.

Deliverables:

This setup code is necessary for the following list of deliverbles.

    my $matrix     = Math::GSL->Matrix->new(10);
    my $matrix_real= Math::MatrixReal->new(10);

New methods to Math::GSL::Matrix and Math::MatrixReal

    my $A          = Math::GSL::Matrix->new_from_pdl($pdl)
    my $B          = Math::GSL::Matirx->new_from_matrixreal($matrix_real);
    my $pdl1       = $matrix->as_pdl();
    my $mr         = $matrix->as_matrixreal();

    my $C          = Math::MatrixReal->new_from_pdl($pdl);
    my $D          = Math::MatrixReal->new_from_gsl($matrix);
    my $pdl2       = $matrix_real->as_pdl();
    my $gsl        = $matrix_real->as_gsl();

Future Possibilities:

    Creating Matrix objects from slices of higher-dimensional piddles 
    Implement in SWIG/XS for speed

Project Schedule:

    Roughly 3 hours per function ( 1 hour for implementation and 2 hours for tests) 
                   8x3 = 24 hours
    Documentation      =  4 hours

Biography:

    Current maintainer of Math::GSL, Math::MatrixReal and Math::ODE. Member of
    Portland Perl Mongers (PDX.pm). Mentor for Math::GSL in Google Summer of
    Code 2008. I defended my thesis for a masters in Mathematics in April of
    2008 and one chapter of it was accepted as a paper to Communications in
    Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation
