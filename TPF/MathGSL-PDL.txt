Title: Math::GSL, Math::MatrixReal and PDL Interoperability

Name: Jonathan Leto

Duration:  20 hrs

Synopsis: 

Allow Math::GSL::Matrix and Math::MatrixReal objects to be converted to piddles and vice versa for compatible piddles.
This will provide an "easy onramp" for a user of any one of these modules to use features from the others in the same 
project. At a social level, this should have the effect of integrating similar Perl communities and giving people
doing scientific computing with Perl more options and fewer arbitrary barriers.


Deliverables:
    my $matrix     = Math::GSL->Matrix->new(10);
    my $matrix_real= Math::MatrixReal->new(10);

New methods to Math::GSL::Matrix and Math::MatrixReal

    my $A          = Math::GSL::Matrix->new_from_pdl($pdl)
    my $pdl1       = $matrix->as_pdl();
    my $mr         = $matrix->as_matrixreal();

    my $B          = Math::MatrixReal->new_from_pdl($pdl);
    my $pdl2       = $matrix_real->as_pdl();
    my $gsl        = $matrix_real->as_gsl();

Other Possibilities:
    Creating Matrix objects from slices of higher-dimensional piddles
