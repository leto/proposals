Project Title

PL/Perl6

Synopsis

The proposed grant would support the development of PL/Perl6, which allows
people to use Perl 6 as a stored procedure language in the PostgreSQL database.

Benefits to Perl 6 Development
How will this advance the release of Perl 6?

It will allow a very new and large niche of developers access to Perl 6 and a use case for it.

Deliverables
Quantifiable results, including referencing a milestone document or a critical path

0) Convert PL/Perl6 + PL/Parrot to use the new parrot embed API

1) PL/Perl6 working on the latest stable release of Rakudo

2) A continuous integration setup such that PL/Perl6 is tested against newer
versions of Parrot + Rakudo, so the current situation does not happen again.
This will probably be implemented on the GCC Compile Farm and/or the OSUOSL
Supercell project.

3) User-friendly web documentation for developers wanting to use PL/Perl6

4) User-friendly web documentation for installing PL/Perl6

Project Details
A more detailed description.

0) PL/Parrot and PL/Perl6 is currently using a deprecated embedding API.
A newer API is available that behaves better and provides a better interface
for embedding Parrot into PostgreSQL.

This step is the more work than any other tasks in this grant. It involves
rewriting the very core C code of PL/Parrot, which PL/Perl6 relies on.

Project Schedule
How long will the project take (calendar duration, not effort in hours)?

I expect about 6 months.

When can you begin work?

January.

Report Schedule
How do you plan to provide updates on your work?

Yes, I plan to prove at least monthly blog posts with updates.

Note that payments on the grant will be contingent on the successful acceptance of milestones and the submission of reports.
