=head2 Synopsis

Currently the Parrot Embedding subsystem is under-tested and under-documented.
This grant proposes to add documentation for all public Embed/Extend API
functions, write tests to increase the code coverage statistics for
the Embed/Extend API to at least 95%, and update the Parrot Developer Docs (PDDs)
where errors or omissions are found.

=head2 Benefits to the Perl Community

There are many projects that will benefit from a completely documentated and
thoroughly tested Parrot Embed Subsystem. Rakudo Perl 6 is built on Parrot, so
people who want to embed Rakudo Perl 6 in any other application will benefit.
Blizkost is a bridge between Perl 5 and Parrot, and embeds both, so will greatly
benefit from good documentation and tests.  PL/Parrot is a project that aims to
embed Parrot in the PostgreSQL database. Because Parrot is embedded in
PostgreSQL, any language that runs on Parrot then can easily be embedded.
PL/Perl6 is part of the PL/Parrot project, which loads Rakudo Perl 6 bytecode
and therefore embeds a Perl 6 interpreter inside of PostgreSQL, for use in
writed stored procedures. All of these projects will grealy benefit from
complete documentation, as well any any future applications that want to embed
or extend Parrot.


=head2 Deliverables

Quantifiable results e.g. "Improve X modules in ways Y and Z",
"Write 3 articles for X website".

=head2 Project Details

A more detailed description.

If you aren't the primary maintainer of the project you want funding
for, show that you have approval from the primary maintainer.

=head2 Inch-stones

If your grant is going to take longer than a week it's useful to break
down your project into small chunks. This helps everybody track of
progress, and lets you see if your project schedule is practical!

Try and think in "inch-stones" rather than "mile-stones". Breaking down
your grant into many small goals makes it harder to overlook
difficulties, and easier to see progress as you complete your grant.

=head2 Completeness Criteria

Describe how your grant can be evaluated. For instance, code will be
merged in Perl tree, or a module will be released to CPAN with the
specified features, etc.
